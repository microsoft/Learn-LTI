### Scenario 1: Include a new functionality - **Learning Objectives met**
Extend the app to map Microsoft Learn modules to course syllabus objectives

**Suggested Solution:** Each module on Microsoft Learn has specific learning goals. Map these goals to the learning objectives in a course syllabus or class curriculum to understand if and how these learning objectives are being met. 


### Scenario 2: Include another functionality - **Encourage Learning**
Set up a Learn competition board within a class to see who has gone through the most Learn content

**Suggested Solution:** Learn tracks a student's progress so it would just be repopulating a ranking board among students in a class
